# CIS-265
===
This is a collection of sample problems from CIS-265 at Bergen Community College with the intention to expand and improve the practical learnings of the course. Being as many of the most advanced and interesting technological projects today are open-source, the use of this GitHub repository in itself will help each student to be a more proficient and effective software engineer. The source files used in the project **must work** and are generally clean and commented. 

## Feel free to add to the project
If at any time you can think of a better solution to any of the problems(or an interesting alternative solution), please pull request and submit a better version. 

## Credit

Some of the projects will be submitted by other students in the class, and proper attribution will be given at the top and bottom of each source file indicating the original creator.

# Working with Git and GitHub

For some of you, this may be the first time using these two epically powerful tools. They are used almost everywhere in the software world and familiarizing yourself with them will be essential in the future. Why not start now?

> "It looks weird and confusing." 

Yes, it does. It uses some paradigms that you may not be familiar with. Please remember this however, 
Anything is better than using **15 Google Docs pages.**

Luckily there are many awesome resources to learning how to use them. If you just sign up for an account, Github provides a good set of tutorials, and a quick google search will bring up many other resources. 

## Getting Started

* Firstly here are some [Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub.](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) curated by the company themselves.
* I would probably even suggest that you use the Desktop Client at first simply for a smaller barrier to entry, and you can get [right in to the fun stuff.](https://desktop.github.com)
* Of course you can always [just jump in with Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
