# CIS-265
This is a collection of sample problems from CIS-265 at Bergen Community College with the intention to expand and improve the practical learnings of the course. Being as many of the most advanced and interesting technological projects today are open-source, the use of this GitHub repository in itself will help each student to be a more proficient and effective software engineer. The source files used in the project **must work** and are generally clean and commented. 

## Feel free to add to the project
If at any time you can think of a better solution to any of the problems(or an interesting alternative solution), please pull request and submit a better version. 

## Credit
Some of the projects will be submitted by other students in the class, and proper attribution will be given at the top and bottom of each source file indicating the original creator.
