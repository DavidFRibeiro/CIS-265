# CIS-265

This is a collection of sample problems from CIS-265 at Bergen Community College with the intention to expand and improve the practical learnings of the course. Being as many of the most advanced and interesting technological projects today are open-source, the use of this GitHub repository in itself will help each student to be a more proficient and effective software engineer. The source files used in the project **must work** and are generally clean and commented. 

## Please contribute to the project

The purpose of this project is to gather knowledge on the things learned from various students throughout the course, and to provide a platform for all to study, improve, and learn from eachothers code. 

## Credit

Most if not all projects will have multiple source files with alternative solutions to the problem. Proper attribution should be given at the top of each source file indicating the original creator. Since this is not a product, but a collection of smaller programs, feel free to add your own licenses to the end of your source files if you so wish.

# Working with Git and GitHub

For some of you, this may be the first time using these two epically powerful tools. They are used almost everywhere in the software world and familiarizing yourself with them will be essential in the future. Why not start now?

> "It looks weird and confusing." 

Yes, it does. It uses some paradigms that you may not be familiar with. Please remember this however, 
Anything is better than using **15 Google Docs pages.**

## Getting Started

There are many guides, some of which linked below to help get started with using Github for this project. However, for a super easy introductory way of adding a file to the project in the browser, here is a simple tutorial. 

###1. Fork the project. 

 * Get onto the project page and find the fork button. Forking the project will make a copy of the project for your personal use;  You get your own version.

* At the top left you will now see that your name comes before the project. This reinforces and provides reference that you are within your own forked version of the project. 

###2. Add your file. 

* You can click new file, and then add your source code along with information about your new file. Please be descriptive. Once done you will *commit* the new file to the master branch(of your version of the project). Remember to add the proper file extension to the name of the file.

###3. Pull Request. 

* In GitHub, a pull request is used when you request a project or the maintainer of the project to review your changes, and *pull* them into the original source.

* You will notice now that your fork has a new file that the orignal does not. You can select **New pull request** to begin a pull request to get your changes added.

* Now you can compare two different branches(yours, and the original) and Github will tell you if the changes you've made can be merged. So you click **Create pull request** to continue the process. 

* This last step is to flesh out your request with some information and make sure you're doing exaclty what you want to. Once you fill it out, just proceed to click create pull request. 

***You have officially sent in your request to have your additions/edits to the main project added!***

###Wait, though

The was a sort of long and annoying process just to make an edit wasnt it? Thats because we are using the browser to do all that work. I do not recommend limiting yourself in that way. The purpose of this tutorial was to get you familiar with the main ideas, functions, and terminology of using GitHub. All the steps here could be completed in about 60 seconds once you establish a good workflow. 

##Here are some resource to get comfortable with Github

* Firstly here are is a curated list of [Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub.](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
* A few nicely documented guides to [learn the basics.](https://guides.github.com)
* I would probably even suggest that you use the Desktop Client at first simply because there is a smaller barrier to entry, and you can get [right in to the fun stuff.](https://desktop.github.com)
* Of course you can always [just jump in with Git.](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
