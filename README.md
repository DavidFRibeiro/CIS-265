# CIS-265

This is a collection of sample problems from CIS-265 at Bergen Community College with the intention to expand and improve the practical learnings of the course. Being as many of the most advanced and interesting technological projects today are open-source, the use of this GitHub repository in itself will help each student to be a more proficient and effective software engineer. The source files used in the project **must work** and are generally clean and commented. 

## Please contribute to the project

The purpose of this project is to gather knowledge on the things learned from various students throughout the course, and to provide a platform for all to study, improve, and learn from eachothers code. 

## Credit

Most if not all projects will have multiple source files with alternative solutions to the problem. Proper attribution should be given at the top of each source file indicating the original creator.
